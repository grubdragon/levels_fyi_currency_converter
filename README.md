# levels_fyi_currency_converter

# Installation Instructions
To install the extension, follow these steps:

2. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file.
3. Open Google Chrome and go to the extensions page by typing `chrome://extensions` in the URL bar or clicking on the three dots in the top right of the browser, then selecting "More tools" > "Extensions".
4. Activate developer mode by turning on the switch on the top right of the extensions page.
5. Click on the "Load unpacked" button on the top left of the extensions page.

# What works?
I targeted pages which don't have the autoconversion. Like these: 
- https://www.levels.fyi/companies/google/salaries/software-engineer/locations/india?country=113

# Issues
To file a bug, please post a link and a screenshot with marked with the issue areas. I've added only a few fields which aren't supported by levels, but happy to add more if you like!
